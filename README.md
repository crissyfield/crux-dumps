# Chrome Top Website Dumps

This repository contains dumps of the monthly [Chrome UX Report](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/) (CrUX) datasets.

As detailed [in this research paper](https://zakird.com/papers/toplists.pdf), the Chrome UX Report website data is significantly more accurate than other website ranking lists, such as the now defunct [Alexa's Top-Million](https://www.alexa.com) or the [Tranco List](http://tranco-list.eu):

> Using a set of metrics from Cloudflare that estimate page loads and unique visitors, we find Google Chrome's recently released CrUX dataset captures the unordered set of most popular websites significantly more accurately than other top lists, with correlations inline with the differences we see amongst multiple measures of popularity derived from the same Cloudflare data. No other top list enters this range. This, paired with the internal consistency of Chrome metrics, suggests that Chrome does not simply use a metric more similar to Cloudflareâ€™s, but rather that their data is more accurate.

Dumps in this repository are automatically generated by exporting the `origin` and `rank` columns from the CrUX dataset via BigQuery, grouping URLs by rank, and storing the grouped URLs as [XZ](https://tukaani.org/xz/) compressed archives.

This repository is intended as a convenient alternative access, since exporting the data from Google BigQuery is both cumbersome and expensive.


## How to Access the Data?

Metadata about the different dumps is stored in the `meta.json` files in each folder. For example, to show the latest available top-1000 sites, do the following:

```bash
# Get URL of latest top-1000
LATEST_TOP_1000_URL=$(
    curl -sSL https://github.com/crissyfield/crux-dumps/raw/main/meta.json \
      | jq -r '.years[].months | sort_by(.id) | last | .files[] | select(.rank == 1000) | .url'
)

# Download dataset and decompress
curl -sSL $LATEST_TOP_1000_URL | xzcat
```

#### Notes

1. The `rank` column has been available since Chrome UX Report `202102`, so dumps of earlier datasets are not part of this repository.
2. The granularity of the `rank` column has changed over time, so don't assume that every rank is always available.
3. Dumps are not cumulative, i.e. URLs in dump `1000.txt.xz` are <u>not</u> included in dump `5000.txt.xz`.
